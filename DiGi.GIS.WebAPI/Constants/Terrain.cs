        /// <para>The cap is a half-extent, so the largest search area is 4 km by 4 km. Counties are sampled onto a lattice between 10 m and 100 m, which puts the worst case at roughly 160 000 points.

        /// <para>Expressed as a multiple of local spacing rather than as a distance, because the stored lattice is not the only sampling this has to survive: points added where the ground moves sharply make one area denser than another, and any fixed distance is then simultaneously too tight for the coarse part and too loose for the fine part. A factor measures each triangle against its own vertices and needs no retuning when the sampling changes.</para>
        /// <para>The consequence to know when reading a served mesh: an empty area entirely enclosed by terrain - a lake, or a pocket the elevation service has no data for - is now spanned flat rather than left open, because nothing over it reaches the boundary to be removed. That is acceptable for a surface that is rendered; it is not a licence to treat the mesh as measured ground everywhere it has vertices.</para>
        /// <para>On the present 100 m lattice this behaves like a limit of about 250 m. It only governs the outer edge: <see cref="DiGi.Geometry.PointCloud.Core.Query.ErodedIndexes"/> removes triangles from the boundary inwards, so a point missing from the interior keeps the triangles around it and reads as a flat spot rather than a hole.</para>
